# Diffraction-Efficiency-Calculator
This is some quick code that will allow you to calculate the diffraction efficiency of a Hologram using Matlab.

To use this program, first record a hologram. Then take a picture of the remaining light after the hologram. Import this picture into the code. Determine your %error and input that into the code as well. Run the code. Draw a line on the image by first left clicking one point then right clicking on another point. Lastly, using the graph determine the average brightness of the light remaining section and the diffracted sections. Scale the graph to 0. Divide the diffracted portion by the remaining light. This will give you your diffraction efficiency .
