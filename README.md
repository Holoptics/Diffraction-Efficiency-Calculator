# Diffraction-Efficiency-Calculator
This is some quick code that will allow you to calculate the diffraction efficiency of a Hologram using Matlab.

To use this program, first record a hologram. Then take a picture of the remaining light after the hologram. Import this picture into the code. Determine your %error and input that into the code as well. Run the code. Draw a line on the image by first left clicking one point then right clicking on another point. Lastly, using the graph determine the average brightness of the light remaining section and the diffracted sections. Scale the graph to 0. Divide the diffracted portion by the remaining light. This will give you your diffraction efficiency .

# v0.1
Inital coding

Includes Initial Testing Picture

# v0.2
Changed how files are uploaded to the code. Now users are taken to a file browser and asked to find their image.

Included more Testing Pictures

Included Filters for Image Manipulation

Disabled the ability to see efficiency numerically

   While this is an important part of the program, we are still working on the best way to implement this in an easy to use manner. However, the old code is available if you still need to see the numerical data for diffraction efficiency. It should work with the new file import system, but hasn't been checked yet.
